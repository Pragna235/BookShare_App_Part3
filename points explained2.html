    <h1>Points Explained</h1>
    <p>	In order to trade books, you need to earn points which you use up as you get free books from other people.</p>

    <p>You earn points when you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type books in:</strong> Enter books you own and want to give away. Each book typed in gets you a point. For new users, 5 points will be credited upon login.</li>
        <li><strong>Give books away:</strong> Respond to a share request, and send your book to them. 1 point awarded if within same organization, 3 points awarded if otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>You use up points when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Receiving Books:</strong> Each book you receive costs you 1 point if within the organization, 2 points if otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>Some Additional Facts</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3:1 ratio</strong>You have send atleast 1 book for every 3 you receive. If you don't keep this ration up, you will not be able to receive any further books.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback score:</strong>If your feedback score is bad, people may refuse your share requests. Efficient response and well-packaged books in good condition earn good feedback points.</li>
        <li><strong>Lost in the mail: </strong> If a book is "lost in the mail" the sender gets their point anyway, and the receiver doesn't lose a point. You're allowed a limited number of "books lost in the mail" in order for us to limit possible fraud.</li>
    </ul>
